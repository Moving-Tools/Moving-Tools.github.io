This site was created to estimate your new utility bill after a move.


*Mobile-first*

An iconized hamburger menu is the default and is replaced by a large text menu. Much of the page scales with viewport size.

Flexbox is used to organize the menu, form, and step tracker visualization. Step tracker is hidden by default for very small screens and enabled my media queries.

First and last child selectors are used for the menu so overlapping lines aren't drawn, the last menu item has a rounded corner, and the menu is scalable for more menu items.


*Interactivity*

The form is functional and has working regex validation and calculation. Data is sourced from EIA.gov and hard coded in an object.

Dynamically importing reference data is still in progress.
